# Robot
Robot for my interview
You should implement a RobotCall class in Java
•	The robot should have the configurable number of legs
•	Each leg should make a step and print to the stdout something like “RobotCallTest moved with leg 1”
•	Every leg should move in a separate thread (should be associated with a separate thread)
•	The steps should be done in the same order, as legs are defined, e.g.
OK:
RobotCallTest moved with leg 1
RobotCallTest moved with leg 2
RobotCallTest moved with leg 3

NOK:
RobotCallTest moved with leg 1
RobotCallTest moved with leg 3
RobotCallTest moved with leg 2
•	The robot should have the distance counter. Each step should update the counter and once the distance is reached, the program should exit and print the number of steps done
•	Please implement a random step calculator as well (average step is one meter, but in should vary from 0,5 to 1,5 meters)
•	Implement an inflight configuration of robot legs as well (can be done with UI or configuration files, it is up to you. The user should be able to remove or add legs for a running robot.)
•	Program input parameters should be the initial quantity of legs and distance (in meters).
